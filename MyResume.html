    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Computer Science student at the University of Jeddah, and an active

      principles and a deep interest in cybersecurity. I am confident that I can
      make a positive impact in any organization that values cybersecurity and
      innovation. Feel free to connect with me to discuss potential
      opportunities or to share insights on the latest trends and developments
      in cybersecurity.

        which is slow and not connected with each other (no primary key) and the

        visitors wanted to search for a specific artist and his work they could
        not find him because of the messy files.
